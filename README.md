# Blockchain-Based Pharmacy & Prescription Management System

A secure pharmacy management platform powered by blockchain technology that connects pharmacists and patients.  
The system ensures prescriptions are tamper-proof, traceable, and accessible only by authorized users.

## Problem Statement

Traditional prescription systems are often paper-based or stored in centralized databases.  
This creates risks such as:

- Prescription tampering or forgery  
- Loss of medical records  
- Lack of transparency between pharmacies and patients

## Solution

This platform uses blockchain technology to securely store and manage prescription data.

- Pharmacists create verified prescriptions  
- Patients receive prescriptions via QR code or ID  
- Records cannot be altered by patients  
- Only authorized pharmacists can update prescriptions  
- Medicine history becomes transparent and traceable
